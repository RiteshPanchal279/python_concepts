      <h1>Anudip Foundation - Home</h1>
      <p>
         Anudip transforms lives by creating aspirational livelihoods through digital inclusion in emerging economies.
         A nonprofit company with operations in India and USA, Anudip has been empowering motivated young job aspirants
         from difficult backgrounds since 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
         Anudip beneficiaries, youth and women, are from high-need marginalized communities, religious minorities,
         tribals, political refugees, people with disabilities or victims of trafficking. They are led through a process
         of continuous improvement, in-depth and diverse training and continuous mentoring at the various skill
         development training centres across India.
      </p>
      <p>
         Anudip’s stellar placement record stems from its training programs being tailored to actual needs of employers,
         as well as to students’ career aspirations.
